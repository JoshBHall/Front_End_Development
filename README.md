# Learning Front End Development
 This repository includes projects I worked on in The Tech Academy's Front End Development course, working with Angular, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, and more!

 ## Projects
 * Student Portfolio
 * Advanced JavaScript
 * Todo App
 * React Projects

 ## Student Portfolio
 Using knowledge of JavaScript gained in this Front End Development course I upgraded my previous portfolio site by adding JavaScript functionality.  It's much more sleek and responsive now, and just more attractive in general.  Using JS I was able to add a slideshow and buttons to move through it, as well as a responsive, popup contact form.

 ## Advanced JavaScript
 In this project I made a series of HTML and JavaScript files learning JS and adding scripts into my HTML.  I also learned some JSON including stringify, parse, and local storage methods.

 ## Todo App
 This app is a very simple todo app able to create a list of things todo, and then cross them off the list when completed.  To make this app possible I learned more JavaScript methods such as how to create a button with an x to remove items from the list by using a for loop and addEventListener.

 ## React Projects
 This is a series of html files with react scripts written in.  I used these files to practice and learn react methods such as setInterval and how to link react in the head element of html.
